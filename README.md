# GeneticAlgorithm
Old code for my genetic algorithm implemented to attempt to optimize a solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem. Code is old, and the graphics have some glitches. The screen must be resized in order to show the charts, and the 'k' key must be pressed to initiate the algorithm. The space bar shows or hides the non-optimal solutions from the current generation. In order to run the program, 'main' in GeneticAlgorithm.java must be run.
